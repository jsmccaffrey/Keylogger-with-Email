# Keylogger with Email

Keystroke Monitoring System written in C# for Windows  
When deployed, logs will be sent to email of choosing  

Created and used for _**educational purposes only**_

I learned the following:
 -  Windows Defender did a great job immediately detecting the keylogger threat and containing it. I had to manually allow the program for testing and monitoring.
 -  When uploaded to VirusTotal.com, it listed 37/72 security vendors would flag the file as malicious. These include popular options such as AVG, BitDefender, Avast, McAfee, Google, Microsoft, etc.
 -  Even when manually allowed or if it ever passes through security by some chance, the program can still be seen running in the Task Manager. Meaning if a unfamiliar program is spotted, it is always worthwhile investigating further
 -  To add on, if one is cautious, they should also check any suspicious startup items.
